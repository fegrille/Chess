### 1. Motivation for this game
Create a game for Software Engeneering to improved programming skills and to learn some new tools to improve code style.

### 2. Rules of this game
You game is a player vs player game which means you need two people to play this game (or you like to play against yourself). The aim of this game is to beat the king of your opponent. As first the player with the white figures will start to make his move, then his opponent with the black figures will make his move and so on.

* Special Rules
  1.  If a pawn reaches the other side of the field you can exchange this pawn with a Queen, a Rook, a Knight or a Bishop.
  2.  With special conditions you can move your rook and your king at the same time.This move is called "castling". The conditions are:
      * King hasn`t moved.
      * Rook hasn`t moved.
      * King doesn`t stand in chess.
      * The position where the king will move to will not make him stand in chess.
      * The fields where the king will be moved about are not in chess.
      * The fields between king and rook are free.

### 3. Several Informations
For this game we used MVC-Architecture. To improve our code style we used Sonar, Maven and Jenkins. We also wrote a lot of tests to secure the functionality of our code, implemented design patterns, used OO-Principles. We are a team of 2 students so we used git and scrum to work together. We used scrum to coordinate our tasks and we used git for version control so every one could get the code all the time.

One more thing is that we implemented a Tui(Text user interface) and a Gui(Graphical user interface). Both can be used to play the game at the same time. The Tui is used as a logger to know what happened when you do something.

### 4. How to play the game
After you import the program to your locale git you can start the game by running Startgame.java. The gui and tui will start.
The Gui will look like this:
